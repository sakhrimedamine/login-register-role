 This project is made to implement a role based authorization / access control using Angular 9 and to setup a simple login page using JWT authentication.

I used :
```
    CanActivate guard to ensure that users are authenticated and have the appropritate role
    HttpInterceptor to simulate the backend and to add tocken to each request
```
